📊 Sales Retail Grouped Analysis (SARGA)

This project is a small analytics engine built in Python using pandas and matplotlib.
It loads a retail sales dataset and provides multiple business-focused insights such as:

Which categories bring the most revenue

How sales change day by day

Which customers spend the most

How categories compare by average performance

Dynamic filtering by date, category, and customer

The goal of this project is not just to plot charts, but to practice analytical thinking — slicing data, aggregating it, and answering real business questions.

🔧 Features

Sales by Category – Total revenue per category (bar chart)

Top Categories – Highest performing categories by sales

Daily Revenue Trend – Time series of daily revenue

Category Performance Comparison – Average revenue per category + order count

Filter by Date – Drill into a single day’s sales

Filter by Category – Analyze a specific business segment

Filter by Customer – See customer spending behavior

All outputs are shown as both tables and charts.

🗂 Dataset

The project uses a CSV file named SARGA.csv with the following structure:

OrderID,Customer,Category,TotalSales,Month,Date
1,Ali,Electronics,200,Jan,2022-01-01
2,Sara,Clothing,50,Jan,2022-01-02
3,Ali,Electronics,300,Feb,2022-02-01
...

▶️ How to Run
python SARGA.py


Edit the bottom of the file to call any function you want:

SARGA.FilterByCategory("Electronics")
SARGA.FilterByDate("2022-01-01")
SARGA.SalesbyDay()

🧠 What This Project Teaches

This project is focused on analysis logic, not just pandas syntax:

Filter → Group → Aggregate → Compare → Visualize

Turning raw data into business answers

Building features that later feed ML models

This is the same thinking used in real data analytics and ML pipelines.
